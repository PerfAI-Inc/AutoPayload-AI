# AutoPayload-AI Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for the AutoPayload-AI project, organized to mirror the source code structure for easy navigation and understanding.

## Documentation Structure

The documentation follows the same structure as the `src/` directory:

- **[index.md](./index.md)** - Main application entry point documentation
- **[storage/](./storage/)** - Storage service documentation
  - **[index.md](./storage/index.md)** - Storage module exports and factory
  - **[localStorage.md](./storage/localStorage.md)** - Local storage implementation
  - **[storage.md](./storage/storage.md)** - Storage interfaces and types
  - **[utils.md](./storage/utils.md)** - Storage utility functions

## Project Overview

AutoPayload-AI is a Playwright-based automation tool designed to capture comprehensive web interaction artifacts. The system automatically generates screenshots, DOM snapshots, HAR files, and traces during web browsing sessions, with organized storage management for later analysis.
